            <img src="./images/headshot.jpg" alt="My Picture" id="headshot">
            <p>My programming experience comes from a blend of online courses like Bloc and Codecademy, working in <span class="emphasise">C# and GML</span> for game 
                projects in Unity and GameMaker Studio, and automating processes through macros and logic at my last few jobs. 
                I've worked with <span class="emphasise">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, GML, SQL, and VBA macros</span>, and a lot of my focus has been on 
                improving existing processes to make them more efficient, which is one of my passions. In my free time, I typically 
                can be found reading a book, working on the design for my next game, or spending time with my wife and toddler. 
                I recently ran a <span class="emphasise">successful Kickstarter campaign</span> for my party trivia game, Standing Out, and have released it to the public.
            </p>
            <p>In my past few jobs, I've worked cross-functionally with multiple departments in order to improve our processes and increase communication within
                the companies. I enjoy this type of collaboration within a position because I believe it brings a company together as a single unit across
                multiple teams.

                    <p>This is a the final product of a series of escape room puzzle games that I made for my friends and family to solve. The initial designs 
                        were single page puzzles with a few clues and locks, but this design included a full game with story.

                    <p>This is a project for a text adventure in a similar vein of classics like Zork. The user finds themself in a room with the need to escape.
                        In order to do so, they must type in commands to look around the room, searching for items that will help them escape. The game features
                        two rooms, 52 interactive items, an inventory system, 11 achievements to unlock, and 3 ways to escape.

                    <p>This project was created because I had issues with the accuracy of my reading log on Goodreads. I reached out to them a few times, but they were
                        never able to solve the problems. Instead of waiting and hoping, I created this project to track and analyze my reading.

                    <p>This was the first game I ever coded. It was made using GameMaker: Studio. Cave Escape is a 2D platformer game for Windows that features 5 worlds 
                        filled with enemies, bosses, secrets, achievements, and over 60 different levels. It can be played using a keyboard or an Xbox controller. </p>
